		Students of Character For Kids Â®
	</h3>
	<p>
		Since the beginning of the Character for Kids program numerous seminars have been conducted in Russia, Ukraine, Lithuania, Estonia, and Hungary.  During this time we have observed changing attitudes among students and faculty alike. The way students view themselves and how they react to daily challenges and circumstances are being changed for good. We are greatly encouraged when we think about how these teachers and future teachers will be influencing our future world by teaching the CFK curriculum.

	<h3>
	  	Student Association
	</h3>
	<p>
		In 1999, the students at Volgograd State Pedagogical University took the initiative to form a Character Development Trainers' Association. 
	</p>		
	<h4>The association was formed to:</h4>
	<p>
		Promote the understanding of CFK's seven universal moral values and the many roles that education plays in the shaping the perpetuation of cultures, the development of mutual understanding between nations and influencing the lives of individuals in a changing world. 
		Improve opportunities for the citizens of the world by fostering an understanding of how a person's character is formed in early childhood by parents, teachers and the educational environment. 
		Increase cross-cultural understanding through the educational process of the study of character development and practices that affect individual and social well-being.

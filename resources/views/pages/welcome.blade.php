		Welcome to Character International, Inc.
	</h3>
	<p>
		Character International, Inc is a nonprofit initiative to promote character education among youth and young adults in the global community with special emphasis in Russia and Eastern Europe.
	</p>
	<p>
		American teachers are trained to go and teach Character For Kids Â® seminars to teachers and university students who are training to be teachers. Through a series of seminars future teachers learn the developmental process of acquiring moral values and how to instill these traits in children.  There is particular emphasis on the teacher being a model of character. 
	</p>
	<h3>A Real Need Exists</h3>
	<p>
		Throughout the global community of nations, thoughtful leaders and educators are becoming concerned about the lack of character development during the formative years. There is general agreement among scholars that good character traits are not innate and must be acquired through teaching and practice.  Ideally, this teaching is done in the home environment and reinforced in the schools. However, due to societal changes around the world and the decline in morals, many children today are not receiving adequate moral training and guidance at home. Consequently, it is becoming necessary for educators to respond to this challenge. If we want our future world to be one of peace and prosperity, teachers must be equipped to teach and model good character.

		Character International Inc. is a nonprofit initiative which is supported exclusively through the generosity of caring individuals and organizations. This nonprofit corporation is organized for charitable and educational purposes under section 501 (c) (3) of the Internal Revenue code.

		In short, there are no paid employees and all funds are used to further our goals of training teachers in Russia and Eastern Europe. This good work is carried out through the liberality and kindness of benevolent people around the world.

	<p>
We encourage you to take a moment to reflect upon how you might help train young people to grow into men and women of character. Your tax deductible contribution could very well change the future of our world -- a world where violence is no longer tolerated and peace is universal.
